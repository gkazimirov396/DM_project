# BFS & DFS Discrete Mathematics Project

### ðŸ’¬ Project Description

This project consists of two parts: the practical part and the experimental part. The practical part includes: implementing a `Graph` datastructure, 
adding the logic to visualize the graph in the form of adjacency lists or an adjacency matrix, adding a method for generating random graphs of given size and density, and, of course, providing
an implementation for the `DFS` and `BFS` algorithms, that work with both adjacency list and adjacency matrices. For the experimental part, the task was to perform computational experiments and 
evaluate the execution time of the algorithms for graphs of different sizes and densities, and afterwards to analyze the received data and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of `DFS` and `BFS` algorithms.

## ðŸ§µ Project Structure
